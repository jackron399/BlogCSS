				Void rays are a unit in Starcraft 2 that have been in the game since its original launch. When the game came out, it was a popular strategy for protoss players to make their armies purely out of void rays. This is for a few different reasons. Perhaps the most obvious reason is their firepower. Void rays shoot a laser beam that does a very high amount of damage per second, and the longer they attack a target, their attack gets more damage and range. Even today with a few nerfs and a large number of new units, void rays still have their place in the game.

				It is a little bit more rare to see someone make an army solely out of void rays in the current expansion for a few reasons. One of these reasons is that people usually make armies that play to the strengths and weaknesses of the units in the army, but void rays do remain a versatile unit. If an opponent were to mass void rays, it would still be very difficult to beat their army without using units that can provide an effective counter due to the high damage per second that void rays are able to output. Another reason is that void rays have had some of their stats reduced since the original launch of the game. And finally, each new expansion to the game also brought new units into the multiplayer scene that are powerful in their own right.

			Void rays are a formidable unit, but they do have weaknesses. One weakness is their speed. Void rays move very slow, and they can find themselves unable to get out of bad situations. Another weakness is one that all Protoss share: they have shields that recharge, but if they take life damage, it cannot be repaired meaning any hull damage to each void ray is permanent meaning engagements can lower the total durability of the army. Another weakness is that they do fire a high damage laser beam, but they can only hit one unit at a time. This means that units that have less durability and high damage can destroy armies of void rays quickly. One of the first units that comes to mind is the marine. Marines are cheap units that sport low durability but high damage. An army of marines could easily destroy the much more expensive army of void rays while replacing losses quickly and efficiently. The Zerg hydralisks are effective for a similar reason to the marines. Air superiority fighters are also typically good against void rays. Typically, air superiority fighters are very fast which can be a good counter to the void rays that are slow and need time to ramp up their damage. The Terran vikings have a good speed, but they sport an even better range with powerful anti-capital missiles. A force of vikings can easily lead and destroy a group of void rays with minimal losses. Protoss phoenix are lightning fast and can move and shoot which can help counter the ramp up period of the void ray. A more interesting counter would be the Terran liberators. This is due to a weird game mechanic where flying units stack up on top of each other while moving. Liberators do not have as much range as vikings, but they fire missiles that do area damage meaning they can do large amounts of damage to the entire group of void rays very quickly. Protoss high templar can use their psionic storm to do large amounts of damage due to this mechanic as well. Similarly, Zerg can make scourge which are flying suicide units that blow up for large amounts of damage in an area, which makes them a nightmare for void rays.
